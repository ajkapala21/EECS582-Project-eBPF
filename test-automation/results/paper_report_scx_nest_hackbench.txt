EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------

CONTROL VERSION (No Cleanup):
  - Map entries accumulate over time (no cleanup)
  - Memory usage may grow unbounded

  Final map entries: 0

TEST VERSION (With Cleanup):
  - Map entries are actively cleaned up
  - Memory usage remains bounded

  Max map entries observed: 0
  Final map entries: 0
  Total entries evicted: 0

DETAILED METRICS

Control Version Runs:
  hackbench_run1.csv:
    Max entries: 0
    Final entries: 0
  hackbench_run2.csv:
    Max entries: 0
    Final entries: 0
  hackbench_run3.csv:
    Max entries: 0
    Final entries: 0

Test Version Runs:
  hackbench_run1.csv:
    Max entries: 0
    Final entries: 0
    Total evictions: 0
  hackbench_run2.csv:
    Max entries: 0
    Final entries: 0
    Total evictions: 0
  hackbench_run3.csv:
    Max entries: 0
    Final entries: 0
    Total evictions: 0

CONCLUSION
----------
Cleanup mechanism is active but no evictions were recorded.
This may indicate all entries were fresh or the workload was too short.
